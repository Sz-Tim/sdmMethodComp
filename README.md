# SDM method comparison

The goal of this project is to compare the predictive abilities of several common approaches for building species distribution models (SDMs). 
Specifically, we evaluate a top-down correlative method (MaxEnt) and two bottom-up mechanistic methods (Integral Projection Models (IPMs) and Cellular Automata (CA) models). 
There is a general assumption [citation needed] that the mechanistic models should perform better since they include the known ecology and biology of the focal species rather than relying on statistical relationships between presences and various environmental variables, but this has never been directly evaluated. 
We use simulated data to assess the predictive accuracy of each approach under a variety of realistic scenarios and common sampling issues.
